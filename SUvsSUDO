A major key difference is who gets the root password. If a user wishes to su to
root then they require the password of the root account. If instead the user is
executing a command with sudo, they only need their own password and sudo
privileges. Therefore if you have multiple users that require root privileges
on a system, providing sudo access is considered to be more secure as we can
audit commands that have been executed by specific users without sharing the
root userâ€™s password with other people.

By default a non root user could use sudo privileges to change the root
password, however the /etc/sudoers file can be used to only grant root access
to specific commands that the user needs to run as root rather than being able
to run anything as root. With sudo we can define security policy, allowing one
group of users to perform only a specific subset of clearly defined commands as
the root user.
