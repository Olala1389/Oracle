git --versio
git config --global user.name 'Olga Makarova'
git config --global user.email 'olga.alex.makar@gmail.com'
git config --list - gives us all configuration values

There are two scenarios in using git
____________________________________
1 scenario - we have an existing local project which we want to start tracking. 

Go to the needed local directory

git init
git status - shows that we have untrached files

git add file1 / git add -A (if we want to add all untracked files)
git commit -m 'comment'
git reset - remove some files from the stagint area
git log - to see commits
_____________________________________
2 scenario - we want to track an existing remote repository with git

git clone <url> <where to clone the repository> - we can indicate . as the place where to clone. When cloning, there must be no git initialized in the local directory. It must be completely new and empty

git remote -v
git branch -a
git diff - after we modify the files or add any new files we can run command 'git diff' to see the changes we made since the moment we clones the remote repository.

git add -A - we need to stage our changes
git commit -m 'comment' - we need to add our changes to commits in the local repository.

git pull - every time we want to push our commits we need to git pull, because other users may have already saved some changes while we were working on our files. 

git pull origin master - we do not indicate the name of the repository, because we cloned from it and the system considers it as origin 

git push origin master - to push our local changes to the remote repository. Again, we do not need to write the name o the repository, because it is 'origin' for us anyway. 
______________________________________
Our default branch is always called a 'master' branch.

We can creat a sub-branch, which will be a working branch for us.

git branch sub-branch - we created a branch named 'sub-branch'

git checkout sub-branch - we cd to that newly created branch

git checkout master - we cd to the master branch

git branch - desplays the ls of branches and the * current branch.

git add -A - we stage all changes we make in any files in sub-branch
git commit -m 'comment' - we commit these changes

git push -u origin sub-branch - we push our changes and create a sub-branch in remote repository.

git checkout master

git merge sub-branch - we merge our branhes locally

git branch -d NAME OF BRANCH - deletes the branch

git branch -a  - displays all branches including remote ones 

git push origin --delete NAME OF THE BRACH - deletes the remote branch we have already deleted locally.
________________________________________
We can track our local repository and store it in remote.
git init - in the local folder, the folder may or may not contain already created local files for tracking
git remote add REMOTE REPO NAME url
git remote -v - shows what branches exist locally and remotely
git push -u REPOSITORY NAME branch
